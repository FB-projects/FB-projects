Link to the classes I was teaching during my last semester before joining the army: http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~bukhari/

CISC 3150 was advanced programming in Java.
CISC 1001 was an introductory class designed to get people to start programming.

On the website you can find my notes, syllabi, homeworks etc.
